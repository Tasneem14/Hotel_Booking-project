# Hotel Booking Analysis 
This is my first Jupyter Notebook project, which analyzes the Hotel Booking dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore the data and create visualizations using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
### Installing
You can install these libraries using pip:

```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn```


## Dataset
The Hotel Booking dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand). This dataset contains hotel booking information such as hotel type, customer demographics, booking dates, and reservation status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I started by exploring the dataset to get an overview of the data. I checked for missing values, duplicated rows, and outliers. Then, I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and filling in missing values.

Next, I used pandas, numpy, and seaborn to analyze the data and create visualizations. 


# Conclusion
In this project, I learned how to use Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, and seaborn to analyze and visualize data. I was able to gain insights into the Hotel Booking dataset, such as the most popular hotel type and the customer segments that cancel more often. This project helped me to develop my skills in data analysis and visualization.
